# Automated Water Pump System for Plants :

## Aim : 
A water pumping system for plants based on moisture content of the soil.

## Theory :  
In this system, soil moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil. If soil will get dry then sensor senses low moisture level and automatically switches on the water pump to supply water to the plant. As plant get sufficient water and soil get wet then sensor senses enough moisture in soil. After which the water pump will automatically get stopped.

## Materials Required :
- Arduino UNO
- 1N4007 - High voltage,high current rated diode
- NPN transistor
- Soil Moisture sensor
- Jumper wires
- resistor
- 5V DC motor
- Water tube
- Hot glue gun
- Water container
- Bread board
